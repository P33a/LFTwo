This version uses the following hardware:
 * [Raspberry Pico IO Shield by Keyestudio](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/KS3017_Keyestudio_Raspberry_Pico_IO_Shield)
 * [Dual Motor Driver Board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009835339347.html)
 * [Waveshare Tracker Sensor Module](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Tracker_Sensor)

   The Shield should have a small wire to expose the Vin voltage in one unused pin.
